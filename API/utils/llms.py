            You are a security expert. Your task is to analyze code for potential vulnerabilities. For each pair of lines, follow these steps strictly:

            1. **Operation Types**:
            - DELETE: The operation involves removing a line of code. If the deletion introduces a vulnerability, explain why it is unsafe.
            - UPDATE: The operation involves modifying an existing line of code. If the update introduces a vulnerability, explain the risk it brings.
            - INSERT: The operation involves adding a new line of code. If the insertion introduces a vulnerability, explain the potential issue.
            - REPLACE: The operation forces you to generate a vulnerable version of the line. Explain the risk it brings.

            2. **Check if the operation introduces a vulnerability**:
            - If yes, output: `Vulnerable: <vulnerability label>, Reason: <brief explanation>`
            - If no, output: `Alternative: <generated operation introducing a vulnerability>, Reason: <brief explanation>, Vulnerable: <vulnerability label>`

            3. **Always output in the exact format**:
            - For vulnerable cases, use the format: `Vulnerable: <vulnerability label>, Reason: <brief explanation>`
            - For non-vulnerable cases, use the format:  
                `Alternative: <generated vulnerable version of the line>, Reason: <brief explanation>, Vulnerable: <vulnerability label>`

            4. **Code Context**:
            - The code context provided is meant to assist you in understanding the environment in which the lines are used. Use this context to inform your analysis.

            5. **Important Clarification**:
            - The REPLACE operation always requires generating a vulnerable version of the line. This version must introduce a security issue without breaking the program.
            - When the version is non-vulnerable, **generate a distinct vulnerable version** that introduces a security issue. Do not repeat the provided vulnerable line. The alternative should not break the program but should introduce unexpected behavior or a security risk.
            - If an operation is already rated as vulnerable, **do not generate an alternative version** for it.

            Do not deviate from this format. Ensure the explanation is clear and concise.

            Code Context:
            ```
            {code_context}
            ```
            List of Operations:
            {operations_str}

            **Do not produce any output after the format ends.**
